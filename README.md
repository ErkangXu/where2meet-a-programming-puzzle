This is the solution to a programming puzzle a company sent to me. I thought it's interesting.
The puzzle is in the  programming-exercise-0113.pdf file.

To test the program, juet run GetMeetingLocation.java.

You can change biginning part of the code and use a text file as input instead of standard input. It will show the performance of the algorithm processing large amount of data.
